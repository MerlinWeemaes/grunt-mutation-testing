* Get rid of some dependencies
* Make types of mutations configurable
* Don't check mutations which are part of untested mutations (option)
* Speedup tests
* Better Documentation
* Document or fix issue of non terminating loops introduced by mutations
* Refactor Code


Done:

* Add statistics
* Configure multiple ignore patterns in a config file
* Stop Karma (including PhantomJS) in a nice way

* At Start run tests without any mutation to test if the test succeeds
* Deploy on npm
